# Cypress and cucumber

This is an example of how to integrate Cypress with Cucumber using the [cypress-cucumber-preprocessor](https://github.com/badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor) 
plugin.

With this setup you can write your test cases with Gherkin syntax and run them with Cypress.

# Get started

Download code by getting zip or git clone

Open it in f.ex  VSC

Open terminal in it

In terminal  type npm i

Once you download everything you can run test  with npx cypress open

# Notes
- The test with Gherkin syntax is located in [cypress/integration/Store.feature](cypress/integration/Store.feature)
- The implementation of the test is located in [cypress/integration/Store/store.js](cypress/integration/Store/store.js)
